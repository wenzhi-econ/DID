This repository stores my notes and some useful resources about recent advancements in Difference-in-Difference methods.


Useful references:
1. The Population and Dynamics and Health Program (PDHP) at the University of Michigan holds a series of workshops introducing recent advances in Difference-in-Differences Method. The corresponding YouTube list is [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIfQuCb6XdT9TmJOkmP7wG5JG8cVUdLt1).
2. Mixtape also have great resources on causal inference methods ([here](https://github.com/Mixtape-Sessions/)). In particular, two sessions are relevant: [Advanced DID](https://github.com/Mixtape-Sessions/Advanced-DID/) and [Frontiers in DID](https://github.com/Mixtape-Sessions/Frontiers-in-DID/).
3. The review paper [What's Trending in Differences-in-Differences? A Synthesis of the Recent Econometrics Literature](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304407623001318) is extremely important.
